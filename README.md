# ContikiCoreForArduino
Library containing some core components of [Contiki-OS](http://contiki-os.org/).

## Components
Contained are a few Contiki core components.  Those are `protothread`s, `process`es, `timer`s and `etimer`s.

The actual scheduling of the processes has to be done in the Arduino main loop, see example.
