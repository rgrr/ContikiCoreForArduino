\author Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se>

Contiki is an open source, highly portable, multi-tasking operating
system for memory-constrained networked embedded systems written by
Adam Dunkels at the Networked Embedded Systems group at the Swedish
Institute of Computer Science.

Contiki is designed for embedded systems with small amounts of
memory. A typical Contiki configuration is 2 kilobytes of RAM and 40
kilobytes of ROM. Contiki consists of an event-driven kernel on top of
which application programs are dynamically loaded and unloaded at
runtime. Contiki processes use light-weight \ref pt "protothreads"
that provide a linear, thread-like programming style on top of the
event-driven kernel. Contiki also supports per-process optional
preemptive multi-threading, interprocess communication using message
passing through events, as well as an optional GUI subsystem with
either direct graphic support for locally connected terminals or
networked virtual display with VNC or over Telnet.

Contiki runs on a variety of platform ranging from embedded
microcontrollers such as the MSP430 and the AVR to old
homecomputers. Code footprint is on the order of kilobytes and memory
usage can be configured to be as low as tens of bytes.

Contiki is written in the C programming language and is freely
available as open source under a BSD-style license. More information

\section contiki-mainpage-threads Multi-threading and protothreads

Contiki is based on an event-driven kernel and provides a lightweight stackless
thread-like construct called protothreads.
